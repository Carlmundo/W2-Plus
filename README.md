## Troubleshooting
 - Do **not** set any compatibility settings on any of the game's files
 - Make sure only one copy of the game is installed to avoid it launching the wrong application
 - If using an old version of Windows, make sure to install updates before the patch.
 - Wine users: make sure win-mono is installed. WineHQ binaries should prompt you for this when needed.
 - Modified Windows users: try enabling DirectPlay manually by running the following command as administrator.  
```dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:DirectPlay```
